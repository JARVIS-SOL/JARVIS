## What's New

+  [2025.01.06] We release Easytool for easier tool usage.
   + The code and datasets are available at [EasyTool](/easytool).
   + The paper is available at [EasyTool: Enhancing LLM-based Agents with Concise Tool Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06201).


##  Key Features

-  Advanced natural language processing
-  Context-aware responses
-  In-depth knowledge across various domains
-  Task automation and problem-solving capabilities
-  Privacy-focused design
-  Multilingual support (100+ languages)

## Overview

Language serves as an interface for LLMs to connect numerous AI models for solving complicated AI tasks!

See our paper: [HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580)

We introduce a collaborative system that consists of **an LLM as the controller** and **numerous expert models as collaborative executors** (from HuggingFace Hub). The workflow of our system consists of four stages:
+ **Task Planning**: Using ChatGPT to analyze the requests of users to understand their intention, and disassemble them into possible solvable tasks.
+ **Model Selection**: To solve the planned tasks, ChatGPT selects expert models hosted on Hugging Face based on their descriptions.
+ **Task Execution**: Invokes and executes each selected model, and return the results to ChatGPT.
+ **Response Generation**: Finally, using ChatGPT to integrate the prediction of all models, and generate responses.

## System Requirements

### Default (Recommended)

For `configs/config.default.yaml`:

+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
+ VRAM >= 24GB
+ RAM > 12GB (minimal), 16GB (standard), 80GB (full)
+ Disk > 284GB 

### Minimum (Lite)

For `configs/config.lite.yaml`:

+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
+ Nothing else

## Quick Start

First replace `openai.key` and `huggingface.token` in `server/configs/config.default.yaml` with **your personal OpenAI Key** and **your Hugging Face Token**, or put them in the environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN` respectively.

### For Server:

```bash
# setup env
cd server
conda create -n jarvis python=3.8
conda activate jarvis
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt

# download models
cd models
bash download.sh

# run server
cd ..
python models_server.py --config configs/config.default.yaml
python awesome_chat.py --config configs/config.default.yaml --mode server

Here's the new README.md file for JARVIS, combining content from both files and incorporating the requested changes:


### For Web:

After starting `awesome_chat.py` in a server mode, you can run the commands to communicate with Jarvis in your browser:

```shellscript
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### For CLI:

You can also run Jarvis more easily in CLI mode:

```shellscript
cd server
python awesome_chat.py --config configs/config.default.yaml --mode cli
```

## Configuration

The server-side configuration file is `server/configs/config.default.yaml`. Some key parameters include:

- `model`: LLM, currently supports `text-davinci-003`
- `inference_mode`: mode of inference endpoints (`local`, `huggingface`, or `hybrid`)
- `local_deployment`: scale of locally deployed models (`minimal`, `standard`, or `full`)
